Note default retract values are for direct drive. stock is 6.5 length  -45-60mms speed. however if changing to all metal it length is much lower start at 1mm do not pass 3mm ish bowden this will lead to a massive clog if the filament is pulled into the heat break. By default cura is also setup to run with bowden. start and end code must be adjusted on the retract lenghts this will lead to clogs , jams , and first layers underextruding / not starting properly. 

note this is not my work credits to ratrig project for listed a variety  of hotends and, default values. note pressure advance values listed would be for direct drive. 
in general its best to leave this 0 and find your value since this will vary printer to printer, and direct drive / bowden have widely different values. other factors 
will be the extruder / hotend design / material. generally 0.05 works well on direct drive delta. however this will depend on the hotend most of the time it not needed due to a delta having high jerk / acc values relative to most printers. this is commonly more useful with thick layer heights or thick line widths. import if reusing the oem flsun thermistor do not change this value in the printer.cfg.
