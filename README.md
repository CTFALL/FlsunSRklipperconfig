# Flsun-super-racer-Full-klipper-config-
complete Kllipper based on klipper docs and flsun marlin. routinely updated with the same functionality and higher spec 
This config is currently compatible with cura after minor klipper specific changes to start gcode under printer settings version 4.12. The 4.10 cura should work by default.
in cura the start gcode is setup to use relative extrusion. this must be enabled in the profile otherwise random movments can and will occure. make sure to change both stock profiles.
