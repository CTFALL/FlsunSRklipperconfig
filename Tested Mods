######################################### BASIC HEAVY DUTY DIRECT DRIVE ##############################################################################
BASIC POP IT ON  DIRECT DRIVE. MIRAGES HextrudORT USES BMG CLONE PARTS OR BMG "REPLACEMENT PART KITS"

NOTE THIS ONE IS MENT TO BE SIMPLE IT IS A BIT HEAVY. 1500 ACC FOR WALL RECOMENDED. INFILL AND OTHER THINGS CAN BE HIGHER. 
CONSIDER IT FOR INDUSTRIAL FILAMENTS AS EVERYTHING IS METAL FOR THE MOST PART. OTHERWISE EASY TO SWAP BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN BOWDEN. 

NOT REQUIRED BUT HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FIX THE ISSUES WITH "STOCK BLOCK FIRST" (Expect slower speeds otherwise)  
1 M6 NUT THREADED ON THE VOLCANO NOZZOLE ALL THE WAY TO THE HEAD. "HOT TIGTHEN AT 295 " THEN REVERSE THE NUT ONTO THE BLOCK THIS WILL DEAL WITH THE EXPOSED 
MELTZONE OF THE NOZZLE / INCREASE FLOW AND, DEAL WITH FANS DROPPING NOZZLE TEMPS. 

ALTERNATE OEM / PROPER CLONE VOLCANO BLOCK. NOTE DO NOT MIX COPPER WITH THE STOCK PTFE BREAK IT SILL JUST DRAIN OUT THE HEATSINK AS THEIR IS NO BREAK TO STOP IT 
UNLIKE ALL METAL. IN ADDITION IT IS WORTH KNOWING THE HEATSINK IS ALSO DIRECT TO THE EFFECTOR MEANING THE WHOLE THING IS A HEATSINK HENCE WHY A BIMETAL OR POSSIBLEY A 
PTFE BIMETAL BREAK WILL BE REQUIRED TO AVOID MASSIVE HEAT LOSS / GENERAL PROBLEMS WITH THE BLOCK.

(FULL LIGHT DIRECT DIRVE ) WORKS WITH A VARIETY OF HOTENDS. https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5027588

AS ABOVE INVOLVING THE BLOCK 

VORON MOBIOUS M4 https://github.com/VoronDesign/Mobius-Extruder
REMIX WITH STANDARD BOWDEN COUPLERS. PERSONALLY I RECOMMEND THIS ONE. 
NOTE AMAZON HEATINSERTS USUALLY ARE SLIGHTLY SMALLER SLICER HOLE OFFSET CAN BE USED TO SOLVE THIS. IDEALLY FIND THE RIGHT ONES. 
DIRECT DRIVE LIKE PERFORMANCE DESIGNED FOR HEAVY USE OF "PRESSURE ADVANCE" EVEN MORE TORQUE. 
EASY TO FIND PARTS , AND PARTS CAN SIMPLY BE REPRITNED IF WORN 
PARTS KITS CAN BE FOUND ON EBAY ALIEXPRESS OR POSSIBLY AMAZON. USES MOST OF THE BMG PARTS HOWEVER NEEDS ADDITIONAL BEARINGS AND, A 5MM SHAFT 

KNOWN HOTENDS WITH "MOUNTS ON THINGIVERSE
DRAGON HF / STANDARD 
DRAGON RAPIDO 
SLICE 9/10 EXTREAMLY UNESSARY OTHER THEN FOR A PRINTER DEDICATED TO EXOCTIC MATERIALS / ABRASSIVES. DUE TO THE PRICE ONE SHOULD KNOW WHY THEY NEED THIS. 
NOTE ANYTHING NOT OEM REQUIRES THE EFFECTOR PLATE TO BE PUNCHED OUT WHERE THE STOCK HEATSINK FITS. (CUT OUT THE CIRCLE) 


I WONT SUGGEST A V6 AND, ITS MAINLY TO DO WITH NO SUPPORT OF ANY KIND TO PROTECT THE 2.8-3MM  THIN  ALL METAL HEAT BREAK. IF THIS BREAKS OFF FOR ANY REASON ITS A FIRE HAZZARD
OR SNAPS OFF DUE TO A WARPED PRINT ETC. THIS APPLYS TO ANY SIMILAR DESIGN. IT SHOULD ALL BE ONE SOLID OBJECT. ALWAYS CONSIDER EVENTUALITY OR FREAK OCCURANCE.

(PRINTABLE EFFECTOR PLATE PA6CF HEAVILY SUGGESTED) https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5339060

(DUCT SPACERS) https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5148686 
THIS SOLVES THE SEMI RANDOM INSTALLS OF BLOCKS DUE TO HOW THEY THREAD ON. STOCK IS PERFECTLY FINE AND, WILL COOL UP TO THE POINT THE NOZZLE HAS 0 TIME TO COOL ANYTHING /
BASIC PHYSICS LIMITS. DUCT SHOULD BE APROX 2MM ABOVE THE TIP OF THE NOZZLE OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT WORK PROPERLY AND, PROBABLY COOL THE BLOCK LEADING TO ISSUES. 

NOTES ON OVERHANGS 
IF FLOW IS INCONSISTANT THEY DONT WORK, BRIDGING WILL ALSO NOT WORK REGARDLESS OF FANS. CALIBRATE FLOW OR INCREASE TEMPS. WITH SOME MATERIALS BUMP LINE WIDTH. EG 0.48 
IF RETRACT IS TO MUCH OR HAPPENS TO MANY TIMES OTHERWISE TO FAST OVERHANGS TEND TO FAIL OR "INTERMITTENTLY WORK" TO LITTLE AS WELL MAY JUST SHOVE A BLOVE WHERE ITS ABOUT 
PRINT LEADING TO THE SAME RESULT. 
IF PRINTING TO "COLD " SAME RESULT. KLIPPER IN GENERAL RUNS HOTTER KEEP THIS IN MIND. MOST PLA STARTS AROUND 220-235. SOME BLENDS CAN BE LOWER USUALLY OR "VIRGIN PLA" 
SEPERATLY SOME PLA REQUIRES CARTESIAN VALUES ITS SIMPLY DESIGNED TO BE SUPER LOW MELT. EG 800 ACC , 60 INNER 30 OUTTER WALLS INFILL 60 MIN LAYER TIME 15-20 SECONDS 
MIN SPEED 15-10 MMS  LOWER ACC MAY REQUIRE  LESS TEMP.
