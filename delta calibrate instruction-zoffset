THIS IS FOR RECENT UPDATES CHECK YOUR CONFIG SIMPLY CHANGE THESE VALUES. 

Values updated to MIN Z POSITION -25. 
PROBE Z OFFSET Z 0 
added endstop_phase_calibrate revision (it wasn't saving at the bottom) 
refer to config or just replace [endstop_phase] 
[endstop_phase stepper_a]
endstop_align_zero: TRUE
[endstop_phase stepper_b]
endstop_align_zero: TRUE
[endstop_phase stepper_c]
endstop_align_zero: TRUE 

SUPER IMPORTANT delta_calibrate doesn't turn off active bed meshs simply delete the mesh in fluidd or main sail etc. it will have to be redone after anyway. 
To state What should be apparent. before doing delta calibrate in particular ensure the bed is perfectly clean this will skew results. 
bed mesh deviation factor will vary printer to printer. after all the steps are complete the bed mesh in theory should be correct. 
depending on the topography of the textured surface of the glass. bed mesh may or may not be nessary. in most cases delta calibrate is enough. 
if deviation seems to be a problem increase probe count. 


step 1 put on probe 
step 2 endstop_phase_calibrate stepper=stepper_(letter) run this for all axis a then b then c  then save_config leave the probe on (note you don't have to save every time just run the command for all 3) 
step 3 delta_calibrate. then save_config leave the probe on 
step 4 probe_calibrate. it will lower click down finish and lift the head a bit. remove probe 
step 4 with either the testz command or the tft with klipper screen lower z using paper tell it touchs with a bit of frction. printer paper recommended or feeler guages. 
do this preheated to avoid filament strands effecting the feel / blobs stuck to the paper. ideally make sure its clean before hand. Once you think its right Save_config
print a large flat square it should be mostly right. baby step to micro adjust. save section at the bottom of the config will now have a zoffset. add or subtract the babystep value 
NOTE do not add it to the z offset on probe that will remain 0. whats active is in the save section of the config. yes you can touch it other things shouldn't be. 

Note once you know your offset. it  doesn't generally need to be changed. 90 percent of the time it may appear to be different but its often flow related or moisture some time model geometry. 
generally this happens changing filament
Makse sure to run bed mesh / delta calibrate at temp your using. results will be skewed by temp differences as the rods / effector / basse change.
its recommended to let it prheat the bed for about 5 -10 mins before running a calibration cycle. after initial setup usally only delta_calibrate and bed mmesh need to be done 
once in awile or with wide tamp changes. eg going from 50 bed to 80-110 for higher temp materials
