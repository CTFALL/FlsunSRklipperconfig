Printer.cfg is now divided between 2 files. both are required to run and go in the usual spot. This was done to "declutter" by moving most things not requiring adjustments.  Must have printer.cfg and, emulator_other_features.cfg. Do not copy and, paste this can lead to formating errors for wheatever Reason.
