Profiles require "Custom Machine" (add printer setup sr as custom machine) mainly this avoids random changes per cura update. Just copy the sr build dimensions etc 
and, past them over to the new "machine" 

Required usual tuning retraction may or may not vary flow etc. Note temps should start at 220 i use a custom hotend values will be set lower for that reason in particular

I will be adding hopfully petg and "regular pla" silk may or may not work with play or just need retraction less surpressed. eg min travel before retract 1.5 -1 and retract
speed 30 
More to come as i have time / X filament in stock.
