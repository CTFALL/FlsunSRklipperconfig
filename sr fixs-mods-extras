known working community mods / fixes tpu spacer for bed can be found under my designs. 
note the sr stock is mostly fine. most mods would revolve around the use of engineering materials. eg hotend / extruder upgrades to accomadate them. 
general disclaimer most problems are related to hotends / extruders mods won't solve underlying problems. and, it should be noted when doing mods it is more then possible to 
accidentally solve a underlying problem at some point during assembly / dissasembly and credit the mod being the solution. when in reality that one loose or off square part may have
simply been reseated and, solved the actual problem. most problems should be repeatable if actually found.
