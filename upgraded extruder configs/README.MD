This is not my work credits to ratrig project for listing variety of extruders and their defaults. 
note just copy and paste the value for whichever the notes on the files are not relivent. 
other notes value for retract by default would be for direct drive. 6.5 mm 45-60mms would be the usual stock retract speed / retract length for firmware retract
if rms_current is listed do not copy this. just use the voltage value klipper does not use "rms_current" in configs.
